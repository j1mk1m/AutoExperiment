Experiment 1: Train a model on VOC2007 dataset with bcos as the model backbone, BCos attribution method, Energy localization loss, and optimizing explanations. Return the IoU after training for 1 epoch in this format {"IoU": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 2: Train a model on VOC2007 dataset with bcos as the model backbone, GradCam attribution method, Energy localization loss, and optimizing explanations. Return the IoU after training for 1 epoch in this format {"IoU": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 3: Train a model on VOC2007 dataset with bcos as the model backbone, IxG attribution method, Energy localization loss, and optimizing explanations. Return the IoU after training for 1 epoch in this format {"IoU": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Return final answer as a json: {"Experiment 1": ..., "Experiment 2": ..., ...}
