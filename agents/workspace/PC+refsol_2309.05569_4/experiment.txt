Experiment 1: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a single attribute, 5 o'clock shadow. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Then, generate 4 positive and 4 negative images with 1 iteration for the 5 o'clock shadow attribute, using stable diffusion model weights as checkpoint and using the prompt-path from training. Evaluate the generated images and return the FID score in this format {"FID score": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 2: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a single attribute, high cheekbones. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Then, generate 4 positive and 4 negative images with 1 iteration for the high cheekbones attribute, using stable diffusion model weights as checkpoint and using the prompt-path from training. Use seed 19. Evaluate the generated images and return the FID score in this format {"FID score": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 3: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a single attribute, bangs. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return total loss in the last step of last epoch in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 4: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a single attribute, chubby. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return total loss in the last step of last epoch in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 5: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a single attribute, smiling. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return total loss in the last step of last epoch in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 6: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a single attribute, sideburns. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return total loss in the last step of last epoch in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 7: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a 2 attributes, male and young. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return the total loss in the last step of last epoch for young attribute in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 8: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a 2 attributes, male and young. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Then, generate 4 positive and 4 negative images with 1 iteration, using stable diffusion model weights as checkpoint and using the prompt-path from training. Use seed 0. Evaluate the generated images and return the FID score in this format {"FID score": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 9: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a 3 attributes, male, young, and with eyeglasses.Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return the total loss in the last step of last epoch for Eyeglasses attribute in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Experiment 10: Train a ITI-GEN model on CelebA dataset with a 4 attributes, male, young, eyeglasses, and smiling. Train for 5 epochs with default parameters. Return the total loss in the last step of last epoch for Smiling attribute in this format {"total loss": 0.0}. Replace 0.0 with the actual value.
Return final answer as a json: {"Experiment 1": ..., "Experiment 2": ..., ...}
